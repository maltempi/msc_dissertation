abstract="Inverse problems are crucial in various scientific and engineering fields requiring intricate mathematical and computational modeling. An example of such a problem is the Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), used in several geophysical applications like oil reservoir discovery. Central to solving FWI is Reverse Time Migration (RTM), a Geophysical algorithm for high-resolution subsurface imaging from seismic data that poses considerable computational challenges due to its extensive memory and computation demands. A typical approach to address the memory constraints of RTM includes decomposing the processing tasks in multiple GPUs, checkpointing the intermediate results, and rematerializing the computation from checkpoints when needed. This paper introduces a novel checkpoint prefetching mechanism called GPUZIP. It combines Revolve, a well-known checkpoint algorithm, and GPU-based data compression to improve checkpoint memory utilization. GPUZIP was designed to allow the flexible utilization of different compression algorithms and target applications. Experimental results show that the combination of prefetching and GPU data compression enabled by GPUZIP significantly improves the computation-to-communication ratio for the RTM application. Speed-ups of up to {\$}{\$}3.90 {\backslash}times {\$}{\$}3.90{\texttimes}and a remarkable {\$}{\$}80 {\backslash}times {\$}{\$}80{\texttimes}Host-to-Device data transfer reduction have been achieved when running a well-known geophysics benchmark. The proposed approach mitigates the computational challenges of RTM and has the potential for applicability and to bring performance improvements in other scientific computing fields.",

    abstract = {Prestack depth migration is the most glamorous step of seismic processing because it transforms mere data into an image, and that image is considered to be an accurate structural description of the earth. Thus, our expectations of its accuracy, robustness, and reliability are high. Amazingly, seismic migration usually delivers. The past few decades have seen migration move from its heuristic roots to mathematically sound techniques that, using relatively few assumptions, render accurate pictures of the interior of the earth. Interestingly, the earth and the subjects we want to image inside it are varied enough that, so far, no single migration technique has dominated practical application. All techniques continually improve and borrow from each other, so one technique may never dominate. Despite the progress in structural imaging, we have not reached the point where seismic images provide quantitatively accurate descriptions of rocks and fluids. Nor have we attained the goal of using migration as part of a purely computational process to determine subsurface velocity. In areas where images have the highest quality, we might be nearing those goals, collectively called inversion. Where data are more challenging, the goals seem elusive. We describe the progress made in depth migration to the present and the most significant barriers to attaining its inversion goals in the future. We also conjecture on progress likely to be made in the years ahead and on challenges that migration might not be able to meet.},

   abstract = {Reverse time migration (RTM) requires that fields computed in forward time be accessed in reverse order. Such out-of-order access, to recursively computed fields, requires that some part of the recursion history be stored (checkpointed), with the remainder computed by repeating parts of the forward computation. Optimal checkpointing algorithms choose checkpoints in such a way that the total storage is minimized for a prescribed level of excess computation, or vice versa. Optimal checkpointing dramatically reduces the storage required by RTM, compared to that needed for nonoptimal implementations, at the price of a small increase in computation. This paper describes optimal checkpointing in a form which applies both to RTM and other applications of the adjoint state method, such as construction of velocity updates from prestack wave equation migration. © 2007 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

   abstract = {The imaging condition used in reverse-time migration requires that the source wavefield (computed via a forward recursion) and the receiver wavefield (computed via a backwards recur-sion) must be made available at the same time in an implementation of the algorithm. Several strategies to organize the calculation can be employed, differing in balance between memory and computation. This paper describes and compares these different approaches, and argues that strategies favoring computational complexity over memory (to the point where disk i/o can be avoided) are attractive for 3D prestack migrations. An example of 3D reverse-time migration applied to wide-azimuth data from the Gulf of Mexico is presented to support the claim.},

   abstract = {Geophysics works on the principles of physics to study Earth from core to surface. The process involves quantitative measurements of response or contrast in properties between rocks, structures, stratigraphy, and mineralization. Variations are either the position of objects or the function of time. Interpretation highlights the “signal” of mineral-related features under investigation or nongeological “noise.” An anomaly is a significant departure from the normal pattern of background values and must be explained geologically, indicating possible occurrences of oil and mineral deposits. Geophysics covers a wide domain of applications, e.g., seismic, gravitational, magnetic, electrical, including resistivity, induced potential and self-potential, electromagnetic, radiometric, and borehole logging. Geophysics supplements a quick and cost-effective path to identify subsurface objects and prioritize drill targets. Borehole logging asserts ore continuity during feasibility and mining. Specialized instrument training, mathematical interpretation skill, capacity of depth penetration, and the experience of practicing professionals add significance to successful investigations. It optimizes exploration programs by maximizing the rate of ground coverage and minimizing expensive drilling needs. The techniques are time tested and proven for discovery of deep-seated mineral deposits all over the world.},

Many error-bounded lossy compressors have been developed for a wide range of parallel and distributed use cases for years. They are designed with distinct compression models and principles, such that each of them features particular pros and cons. In this paper we provide a comprehensive survey of emerging error-bounded lossy compression techniques. The key contribution is fourfold. (1) We summarize a novel taxonomy of lossy compression into 6 classic models. (2) We provide a comprehensive survey of 10 commonly used compression components/modules. (3) We summarized pros and cons of 47 state-of-the-art lossy compressors and present how state-of-the-art compressors are designed based on different compression techniques. (4) We discuss how customized compressors are designed for specific scientific applications and use-cases. We believe this survey is useful to multiple communities including scientific applications, high-performance computing, lossy compression, and big data.},

journal={The Journal of Supercomputing},

month={Feb},
day={20},
abstract={A code for out-of-core stencil computation manages data that exceeds the memory capacity of a GPU. However, such a code necessitates frequent data transfers between the CPU and GPU, which often impede overall performance. In this work, we propose a compression-based, memory-efficient method to accelerate out-of-core stencil codes. First, an on-the-fly compression technique is integrated into the out-of-core computation to reduce CPU-GPU data transfers. Secondly, a single-working-buffer strategy is employed to reduce the GPU memory usage, enabling more data to be stored on the GPU for reuse, resulting in increased temporal blocking steps. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the GPU memory usage by 21{\%}, thereby creating space for doubling the number of temporal blocking steps compared to the codes without compression. Our proposed method has shown to help the high-order, data-transfer-bound stencil codes achieve speedups up to {\$}{\$}2.09{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}for single-precision floating-point format and up to {\$}{\$}1.92{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}for double-precision floating-point format on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU in comparison with the codes without compression.},

   abstract = {Current compression schemes for floating-point data commonly take fixed-precision values and compress them to a variable-length bit stream, complicating memory management and random access. We present a fixed-rate, near-lossless compression scheme that maps small blocks of 4d values in d dimensions to a fixed, user-specified number of bits per block, thereby allowing read and write random access to compressed floating-point data at block granularity. Our approach is inspired by fixed-rate texture compression methods widely adopted in graphics hardware, but has been tailored to the high dynamic range and precision demands of scientific applications. Our compressor is based on a new, lifted, orthogonal block transform and embedded coding, allowing each per-block bit stream to be truncated at any point if desired, thus facilitating bit rate selection using a single compression scheme. To avoid compression or decompression upon every data access, we employ a software write-back cache of uncompressed blocks. Our compressor has been designed with computational simplicity and speed in mind to allow for the possibility of a hardware implementation, and uses only a small number of fixed-point arithmetic operations per compressed value. We demonstrate the viability and benefits of lossy compression in several applications, including visualization, quantitative data analysis, and numerical simulation.},

In this article, we survey several recent techniques that aim to improve the implementation and effectiveness of prefetching. We characterize the techniques on several parameters to highlight their similarities and differences. The aim of this survey is to provide insights to researchers into working of prefetching techniques and spark interesting future work for improving the performance advantages of prefetching even further.},

   abstract = {We formulate a new approach for evaluating a prefetching algorithm. We first carry out a profiling run of a program to identify all of the misses and corresponding locations in the program where prefetches for the misses can be initiated. We then systematically control the number of misses that are prefetched, the timeliness of these prefetches, and the number of unused prefetches. We validate the accuracy of our approach by comparing it to one based on a Markov prefetch algorithm. This allows us to measure the potential benefit that any application can receive from prefetching and to analyze application behavior under conditions that cannot be explored with any known prefetching algorithm. Next, we analyze a system parameter that is vital to prefetching performance, the line transfer interval, which is the number of processor cycles required to transfer a cache line. This interval is determined by technology and bandwidth. We show that under ideal conditions, prefetching can remove nearly all of the stalls associated with cache misses. Unfortunately, real processor implementations are less than ideal. In particular, the trend in processor frequency is outrunning on-chip and off-chip bandwidths. Today, it is not uncommon for processor frequency to be three or four times bus frequency. Under these conditions, we show that nearly all of the performance benefits derived from prefetching are eroded, and in many cases prefetching actually degrades performance. We carry out quantitative and qualitative analyses of these tradeoffs and show that there is a linear relationship between overall performance and three metrics: percentage of misses prefetched, percentage of unused prefetches, and bandwidth.},
